# There Are Only Three Jobs

With the existential threat of AI, there has been a lot of discussion of whether it is going to take our jobs. 

Having worked in tech for since 2019 now, even within my relatively short tenure, I have already seen a few technologies I've used in my day job come and go. Every job has an element that most people do not like, which is why we are paid to do them. In tech, to me, it seems that we paid to keep up to date with technology. Some workers suffer through getting trained but then want to do their job the same way for the rest of their career. In tech, we get paid to constantly be learning to make products or provide services better. Because if we don't, one of our competitors will.

However, someone once expressed that there are only three classes of job at a company. So while exact job titles change over time, these are the three forms that appear. Two or all three may blur together at times, but as companies get larger and roles get more specific, these often seperate out.

## Maker, Manger, Moneyholder.

### Maker

This is what most people will experience at a job. For me, as a software engineer: this means I use tools to produce software. I write code in an editor. I test user experiences to make sure they work as intended. I review my coworker's work to make sure it also works. 

For a chef: this means making food. Using their kitchen to prepare dishes. Tasting food to make sure their customers have a quality meal. Trying their coworker's food to make sure it is right.

This is the base of any job. At it's core, it's providing a good or service to a customer. But technological advancements often means creating tool where the maker process gets easier, faster, or higher quality. This is where AI gets weird.

### Manager

At some point, for whatever reason, enough people start working at a company where it's hard to keep track of what is going on. Makers start making things customers don't actually want to buy. Or they stop showing up to work. Or a team doesn't know what to do next.

So someone starts calling the shots. In an ideal world, they work with the makers and keep them happy and pointed in the right direction. Many people experience this at some point as they become more senior.

For a software engineering manager, this means herding cats and keeping software engineers focused and humming in the right direction.

### Moneyholder

Most people will never experience at a company. But they hold the purse strings. They write the paychecks for everyone. They hire the Makers and the Managers. They are a capital holder or work closely with them. They steer the direction of the company from the helm and ultimately are responsible for what to do with the profits and losses. Hiring people. Buying materials.

## Why does this matter?

The weird thing about AI, is that now some of the makers aren't human. This has been the case before: through this lens, farmers are Managers for their animals, who work as Makers. And small farmers are their own Moneyholders. 

But now, knowledge workers have little Makers in their computers. As AI gets more inteligent, I've noticed that many of the issues they face are actually the same issues I've faced mentoring more junior software engineers. Hallucinating (being wrong) because they don't have enough information. Writing faulty code because they couldn't (or didn't) test their own work. Going off on fruitless rabbit trails because they were given bad information.

So now, with AI dramatically bring down the cost of knowledge work, we now have access to their own army of makers. 

But people who were previously only Makers now are facing the same problems that Managers and Moneyholders have. Managers ask themselves: How do I create an environment where it is easy for Makers to do what I want them to do? How do I correct them when they don't do what I want them do? Moneyholders have to ask themselves: How much money am I willing to spend on labor and materials (now including AI tokens) to produce value for my customers? Is it work spending $100 dollars of compute to complete this task? Can I sell the output more for more?

So if you have access to AI, ask yourself: what can I do now that I have more compute at my disposal? How can I use AI to what better Makers, Managers, or Moneyholders can do.
