My public thoughts, opinions and expertise: in writing. 

I was reading through [Kent C. Dodds Epic Programming Principles](https://www.epicweb.dev/principles) and one of the principals that really stood out to me was [Magnify your conversation impact](https://www.epicweb.dev/principles/career/professional-growth/magnify-conversation-impact). 

In order to make it as easy as possible to do this and avoid this situation ([which I am currently doing](https://joshuayoes.com/)):

This is a living repository that I intend to keep refining and updating over time. I actually want to be challenged on the contents (in good faith) because I find that my best mental models are battled tested through exposure to real life. Feel free to open an issue on this repository if you see something you'd like to have a discussion about.

My ultimate goal with this project is to codify my worldview into a place where I can share and reference it in discussions with other people.

This project is inspired by many techincal founders I admire have their own simple blogs where they share their thoughts:
- https://rauchg.com - Guillermo Rauch, CEO of Vercel
- https://tinyclouds.org - Ryan Dahl, Creator of Node and Deno
- https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html - Paul Graham, Co-founder of Y Combinator

Even if I don't agree with everything they publish, I like this tradition in tech of writing essays spelling out one's worldview.

Enjoy!
